A simple shot'em all game made with HTML5 technology with **Phaser JS 

##What I need to make work the example?

You will need:
 * Node (v0.10.25) is my current version
 * A updated NPM (Node package manager) version I'm working with (1.3.24)

##How I should start with that?

First of all you need to install the dependencies of our project It will be the following:

* grunt: ^0.4.5,
* grunt-browserify: ^4.0.1,
* grunt-contrib-connect: ^0.11.2
* grunt-contrib-copy: ^0.8.2
* grunt-contrib-watch: ^0.6.1
* phaser: >=2.2.0

##Then, how I install my dependencies?

Simple, just run inside of our root project folder the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

That's all folks!
